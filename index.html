      <p>Hi, I’m Thembisile Makamu — a passionate and curious tech enthusiast with a strong interest in front-end development. I
      recently completed the FNB App Academy and the ALX Software Engineering bootcamp, and I’m now looking for an opportunity
      to break into the tech industry and grow my skills professionally.
      
      What drives me is problem-solving, creativity, and the ability to build things that are both useful and beautiful. I
      enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m always learning — whether it’s diving into React, exploring cloud
      computing, or brushing up on design principles.
      
      Before entering tech, I worked in retail for over three years. That experience taught me how to work with people, stay
      organised under pressure, and communicate clearly — all of which I now carry into my work as a developer.
      
      I’m currently job hunting and open to internships, entry-level roles, or even volunteer opportunities where I can gain
      hands-on experience and contribute to real projects. If you’re looking for someone who’s eager to learn, adaptable, and
      committed to growth — I’d love toconnect.</p>
